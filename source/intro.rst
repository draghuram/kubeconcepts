Kubernetes is very much a hot technology these days and this is how
kubernetes.io describes it::

  Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment,
  scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

But what does it exactly mean? It is certainly not an easy technology
to pick up and it really helps to understand the concepts behind its
design and implementation.

This document is an attempt to explain the concepts in an easy to
understand and incremental fashion. I do assume that the reader is
reasonably familiar with Docker and container concepts though I spend
the first chapter in highlighting few container concepts.
