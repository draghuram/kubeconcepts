Kubernetes is very much getting lots of love and mind share these
days. Here is how `kubernetes.io`_ describes it:

  Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment,
  scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

But what does it exactly mean? It is certainly not an easy technology
to pick up and it really helps to understand the concepts behind its
design and implementation.

This guide is an attempt to explain the concepts in an easy to
understand and incremental fashion. I do assume that the reader is
reasonably familiar with `Docker`_ and container concepts though I give
a high level overview in the first chapter. 

Also, all the examples and descriptions in the guide use *Linux* as that
is the operating system I am most comfortable with.
