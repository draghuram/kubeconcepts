I have been working on Kubernetes for almost a year now and started
using Docker many years before that. I really think that
containers and Kubernetes are transformative technologies in the same
way that Virtualization has been a decade before.

The idea to write a guide about Kubernetes concepts came up when I
started preparing for a technical talk at `Catalogic Software`_ (where
I work). Instead of preparing usual slides and notes, I thought that
writing a guide beforehand and then giving the talk would be better. 

There are many Kubernetes tutorials available on the web and the
`Concepts`_ section on Kubernetes website is quite brilliant. However, I
haven't found any systematic presentations where concepts are
introduced in an incremental fashion, starting all the way from
containers and then gradually moving onto Kubernetes features. Hence,
this guide. I hope developers find it useful. 

If you have any comments or corrections, please send email to
"draghuram at gmail.com" or open an issue (or PR) at the `github
repo`_.
